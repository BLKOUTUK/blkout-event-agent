## Test Details

### Repository Structure Test

The repository structure test verified that all required directories exist:

- `events-system/` - Events Calendar system
- `bqm-members/` - BQM Member Management system
- `social-media/` - Campaign Communications system
- `network-recognition/` - Network Recognition system
- `shared/` - Shared infrastructure components
- `mcp-server/` - MCP server implementation

### BQM Member Management Test

The BQM Member Management test verified:

1. **Workflow JSON Validation**:
   - The workflow JSON file is valid
   - The workflow name is "BLKOUT BQM Member Management"
   - The workflow contains BQM-specific references

2. **Email Templates**:
   - Email templates are located in `bqm-members/engagement/email-templates/`
   - Templates have been updated to reflect the BQM focus
   - Templates include BQM-specific content and messaging

### Network Recognition Test

The Network Recognition test verified:

1. **Schema JSON Validation**:
   - The schema JSON file is valid
   - The schema contains network-specific references
   - The schema includes BQM impact fields

2. **Directory Structure**:
   - `point-system/` - Network contribution tracking
   - `achievement-tracking/` - Collaborative achievement tracking
   - `redemption/` - Partnership benefits
   - `recognition/` - Network spotlight
   - `reporting/` - Ecosystem impact reporting

## Next Steps

1. **Import Workflows into n8n**:
   - Import the BQM Member Management workflow from `bqm-members/bqm_member_management_workflow.json`
   - Test the workflow with sample data

2. **Test Network Recognition System**:
   - Create sample network contribution data
   - Test the contribution tracking functionality
   - Test the collaborative achievement recognition

3. **Create Symbolic Links**:
   - Run the `create_symlinks.ps1` script with administrator privileges to create symbolic links for backward compatibility:
     - `onboarding/` → `bqm-members/`
     - `rewards/` → `network-recognition/`

4. **Update External References**:
   - Update any external references to the old directory structure
   - Communicate the changes to team members

## Conclusion

The repository reorganization has been successfully tested and is ready for use. The new structure focuses on community outcomes rather than technical components, with a clear distinction between BQM Member Management (focused on Black queer men) and Network Recognition (focused on the broader networks and communities).
