# Repository Migration Plan

This document outlines the plan for reorganizing the repository into a structured ecosystem of interconnected projects.

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Preparation

1. **Create directory structure**
   - Create main project directories
   - Create subdirectories for each component
   - Set up shared resources directory

   ```
   mcp-server-app/
   ├── events-system/         # Events Calendar system
   ├── bqm-members/           # BQM Member Management system
   ├── social-media/          # Campaign Communications system
   ├── network-recognition/   # Network Recognition system
   ├── shared/                # Shared infrastructure components
   └── mcp-server/            # MCP server implementation
   ```

2. **Document current state**
   - Create file inventory
   - Identify cross-dependencies
   - Document external references

3. **Create project documentation**
   - Create README files for each project
   - Update main README.md
   - Create migration plan (this document)

### Phase 2: File Migration

1. **Move files to appropriate directories**
   - Start with files that have no dependencies
   - Update import statements as needed
   - Test functionality after each move

2. **Update references**
   - Update relative imports
   - Update file paths in configuration files
   - Update documentation references

3. **Handle special cases**
   - Files referenced by external repositories
   - Files with complex dependencies
   - Configuration files with sensitive information

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation

1. **Test each system individually**
   - Verify that each system works independently
   - Check for missing dependencies
   - Fix any issues that arise

2. **Test cross-system integration**
   - Verify that systems can communicate with each other
   - Check for broken references
   - Test end-to-end workflows

3. **Validate external references**
   - Ensure that external repositories can still access needed files
   - Update external repositories if necessary
   - Document any changes needed for external systems

### Phase 4: Cleanup and Finalization

1. **Remove obsolete files**
   - Identify truly obsolete files
   - Archive or remove as appropriate
   - Update documentation to reflect changes

2. **Standardize naming conventions**
   - Ensure consistent naming across projects
   - Update file names for clarity
   - Document naming conventions

3. **Final documentation update**
   - Update all README files
   - Create additional documentation as needed
   - Ensure all cross-references are correct

## Migration Guidelines

### File Handling

- **Never delete files** without confirming they are truly obsolete
- **Create backups** before making significant changes
- **Test thoroughly** after each migration step
- **Document all changes** made during migration

### Dependency Management

- **Map dependencies** before moving files
- **Update import statements** when moving files
- **Test functionality** after updating dependencies
- **Document complex dependencies** for future reference

### External References

- **Identify all external references** before migration
- **Maintain compatibility** with external systems
- **Document changes** needed for external systems
- **Consider creating symlinks** for backward compatibility

## Post-Migration Tasks

1. **Update deployment scripts** to reflect new structure
2. **Update CI/CD pipelines** if applicable
3. **Train team members** on new repository structure
4. **Update external documentation** referencing the repository
5. **Create development guidelines** for the new structure

## Timeline

- **Phase 1**: 1-2 days
- **Phase 2**: 3-5 days
- **Phase 3**: 2-3 days
- **Phase 4**: 1-2 days

Total estimated time: 7-12 days

## Responsible Parties

- **Repository Owner**: Overall responsibility for migration
- **System Owners**: Responsible for their specific systems
- **QA Team**: Testing and validation
- **Documentation Team**: Updating documentation

## Rollback Plan

In case of significant issues:

1. **Restore from backup** if available
2. **Revert to previous commit** if using version control
3. **Document issues** encountered for future attempts
4. **Adjust migration plan** based on lessons learned
